Convert Apple Notes to Markdown!

This is the only viable approach I could find. But it seems to work!

TODO:

- [ ] Select output folder
- [ ] Handle overwrite (flag? Separate ApplesScript to rotate output folder name?)
- [ ] Handle multiple Notes windows open
- [ ] Handle launching Notes and TextEdit
- [ ] Handle (skip) locked Notes
- [ ] Safely iterate over all Notes
- [ ] Convert to Markdown with Pandoc
- [ ] Run unattended
